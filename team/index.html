When the user uploads from either location they can give the meme tags, set it's category, and of course say whether it's NSFW or not. The user can also say whether they want these pictures uploaded individually or to be part of a gallery.

Once the user knows what they're looking for they can sort by relevance, most popular/least popular, and most recent/least recent. We've also added a very important button we personally feel is a missing touch from many similar services. A NSFW filter button. There's nothing worse than searching for something you feel is benign on the internet in public, at work, or at school, only to find a bunch of NSFW pictures mixed in with what you're looking for.

Brian "The Philosopher" Ly has been known to be infront of a computer for countless hours a day either coding, looking at memes, or learning about random useless facts on the Internet. Brian is very pale due to a lack of sunlight and outdoor activities. He has shunned the sun and considers it to be his mortal enemy. He's suspected of being a vampire, but this has been proven false due to lack of sparkliness. In 2006 he was declared socially dead.</p>
